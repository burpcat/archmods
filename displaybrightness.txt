# Since the human can observe minute changes in lower levels of brightness, but the case is not same in higher ranges of
# brightness, to fix this we use a library called brillo, which adjusts the brightness exponentially as to human scale.

1. First we clone the brillo repository
	$ git clone https://github.com/CameronNemo/brillo.git
2. We run the following commands
	$ sudo make
	$ sudo make install.setgid
3. Running just $ brillo gives us the current screen brightness
	$ brillo
4. To increase or decrease the brightness normally we use
	# Increase the brightness by 10%
	$ brillo -A 10
	
	# Decrease the brightness by 10%
	$ brillo -U 10

	# we can adjust the integer at the end to change the percentage of growth

5. To change the brightness according to the exponential scale which is satisfactory to human eye, we can use the -q tag

6. So we bind both the commands to use xbindkeys, we navigate into .xbindkeysrc

7. We place the following lines of code in the file

	# Use XF86MonBrightnessDown to lower screen brightness
	"brillo -q -U 10"
	   XF86MonBrightnessDown

	# Use XF86MonBrightnessUp to increase screen brightness
	"brillo -q -A 10"
	   XF86MonBrightnessUp

8. Now restarting the window manager automatically maps the keys to the brightness and works perfectly
