1. Download the patches to the patches folder
2. Since config.h is the main file in which we do any modifications, we need to first copy config.h to config.def.h
3. Now we need to install the patch using
	$ patch -i patches/patch_name
4. Now we need to run
	$ sudo make clean install
5. If the above step results in an error, we need to manually go to the files, inspect them and correct them
6. Now after completing it, we need to move config.def.h to config.h and run step 4 again
