1. Lookup nerdfonts
2. When $ fc-list is used, all the fonts in the system are listed and the prefix of the font gives away their location
3. Went up the directory /usr/share/fonts and copied the specified font into the directory. (This is where the package manager 
	installs all the fonts, so it is better left untouched
4. If we want a more personalised install location, we can do the same in /usr/local/share/fonts
5. or if we want the fonts only for the specified user, we can do that in .local/share/fonts
6. After copy, run $ fc-cache, sometimes if the cache doesnt get refreshed we need to run $ fc-cache -r
7. The defauly config file is located at /etc/fonts/local.conf
